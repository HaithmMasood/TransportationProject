# Comp 249 Project 2 - Object-Oriented Programming in Java

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions for Assignment 2 of the Comp 249 (Object-Oriented Programming II) course at Concordia University, Winter 2023. The assignment focuses on demonstrating proficiency in class inheritance and other Object-Oriented Programming principles using Java.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this assignment are:
1. **Implementing Class Inheritance**: To design and implement a hierarchy of classes that effectively utilize inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
2. **Practicing Java Fundamentals**: To gain hands-on experience with Java constructors, method overriding, package creation, and access modifiers.
3. **Developing Robust Java Applications**: To create a set of interconnected classes that work together to achieve a unified functionality.

## Class Hierarchy
The assignment involves the following classes:
- `WheeledTransportation`
- `Train` (extends WheeledTransportation)
- `Metro` (extends Train)
- `Tram` (extends Metro)
- `Monowheel` (extends WheeledTransportation)
- `Ferry`
- `Aircraft`
- `World War II Airplane` (extends Aircraft)

Each class has its unique attributes and methods, contributing to the overall functionality of the application.

## Key Features
- **Class Implementation**: Detailed implementation of each class with constructors, toString and equals methods, and appropriate access rights.
- **UML Diagram**: A UML representation of the class hierarchy.
- **Driver Programs**: 
   - Part I includes a driver program that demonstrates the functionality of all classes and a method `findLeastAndMostExpensiveAircraft()`.
   - Part II includes a new driver program with a `copyTheObjects()` method, testing the behavior of copied objects.

## Installation
To run this application, ensure you have Java installed on your system. Clone the repository, navigate to the source directory, and run the main Java file.

## Contributing
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment. While it is not open for contributions, feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
